# This script will sync til project files to a remote server.

# USAGE:
# 1. Place this script in the root directory of the project
# 2. Configure the script by modifying the variables in the "SET BY SCRIPT USER" section below.
# 3. Run ./sync_to_remote.sh
# 4. Rsync will perform a dry run before uploading the files. Verify the files to be transferred are correct, and press 'Enter' to confirm.
# NB: Remember to upload any env/secrets/config files to the server manually if not part of the project.

# Exit script immediatly on any errors
set -e
